## About
I am a doctoral candidate specializing in cognitive development. I am particularly interested in how we develop uniquely human abilities, such as the ability to think about abstract concepts. I have a passion for exploring how language interacts with thought, and how our cultural experiences may influence the development of various cognitive processes. I work with infants, children, and adults to unveil insights into memory, language, and abstract thought. I also employ a diverse range of research methods, primarily using eye-tracking and behavioral paradigms. My goal is to apply my background in cognitive development to work that contributes to our understanding of the capacities of the mind. 

Currently, I am an experimental psychology PhD candidate at the University of Washington, advised by [Dr. Ariel Starr](https://psych.uw.edu/people/8529). In my free time, I like to practice guitar, lift weights, watch a lot of movies, and try new cooking techniques!

## Research
**Current Projects**

* Temporal Memory:
We are examining the relationship between the development of spatial representations of time and the temporal binding component of episodic memory in early childhood. 
 
* The Mental Timeline:
In this project, we use pupillometry measures to ask questions about the origins and development of space-time associations from infancy to adulthood. This work is conducted in parallel with Drs Lola de Hevia and Gisella Decarli at the University of Paris, to further explore cross-cultural differences in the development of spatial representations of time.

* Spatial Language Development:
This work examines the relationship between early spatial language development and performance in non-linguistic spatial tasks. We further explore diversity in the development of spatial language acquisition using multiple language groups with different grammatical structures and monolingual and bilingual participants.
